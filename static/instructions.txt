<h2>What is Vaccine Misinformation?</h2>

Vaccine misinformation is any information given about the vaccine that is false or unproven by scientific research at the time it is released. 

<h3>Misinformation Labels:</h3>

<h4>Misinformation:</h4>
Vaccine misinformation is any information given about the vaccine that is evidently false or unproven by scientific research at the time it is released.

<h4>Controversial:</h4>
Post that leads to the suggestion of a possible vaccination outcome that is false, illogical, or unproven by research studies.
Requires the coder to understand the post’s implications and require further analysis.
Does not have cause/because/leading to statements but its underlying implications or implicit messages may be leaning towards anti vax bias.
The user does not provide captions, or supporting arguments as in links, pictures, or videos that contain misinformation but imply that there is a connection between vaccination and an outcome, disease, or label when there is no evidence showing the connection.
In short, anything that is misleading to the audience should be put under this label.
E.g:  Kid died in hospital, heartfelt post saying they died 4/6 months post vaccination. No cause statements seen but can be implicitly linked to vaccine usage.

<h4>Clean:</h4>
When the post does not show any sign of misinformation or misleading/controversial vaccine information. 

<h3>Vaccination Bias:</h3>

<h4>Anti:</h4>
Any post that contains a negative attitude towards vaccines. 
Eg: Vaccination is bad; vaccines causes autism, narratives that oppose vaccines, etc.

<h4>Neutral:</h4>
A post that does not demonstrate a positive nor negative attitude towards vaccines is considered neutral. 
E.g: a news or facts/ 150,000 kids vaccinated in polio program in India

<h4>Pro:</h4>
Posts that promote or show open support for vaccines are considered a pro-attitude.
E.g. Vaccinations are safe , effective and provide immunity for your child; I love vaccines! 

<h2>Study Focus</h2>

<h4>Vaccine ingredients:</h4> Raw materials or adjuvants that are used to produce/make/manufacture vaccine medications （note: mercury/thiomersal no longer exists in vaccines.）

<h4>Vaccine safety:</h4> Vaccine safety refers to whether the injected vaccine will evoke negative medical conditions. Research has proved that vaccines do not cause diseases; the possibility of long-term side effects from injecting vaccines is very low; combination vaccines are tested carefully to ensure zero or, at most, a mild side effect.Other topics for vaccine safety include historical vaccine incidents and recalls. Any topic that challenges the above evidence is to be categorized as misinformation.

<h4>Vaccine effectiveness:</h4> Whether vaccines safely prevent people from getting targeted diseases. Vaccine efficacy and effectiveness are measures that compare the rates of disease between vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Efficacy is measured in controlled clinical trials, whereas effectiveness is measured once the vaccine is approved for use in the general population. From these we can identify the proportion of vaccinated people we would expect to be protected by the vaccine. 

<h4>Autism:</h4> Also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD); A serious developmental disorder that impairs the ability to communicate and interact. People with autism obtain characteristics such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech, and nonverbal communication. Research has not been able to find any connection between vaccination and autism and whether one causes another. Anti-vaxxers usually claim autism is caused by vaccine usage.

<h4>Shaken Baby Syndrome and Infant Mortality:</h4> SBS is a serious brain injury resulting from forcefully shaking an infant or toddler. Research has not been able to find any connection between vaccination and SBS and whether one causes another. Infant Mortality is the death of children under the age of one. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome contributes largely to infant mortality and there is no clear reason why it happens in infants. However, it is proven that there is no causation between vaccines and SIDS.

<h4>Conspiracies:</h4> False beliefs that are agreed upon by a group of people. The beliefs usually involve mistrust toward official organizations/Governments and are frequently followed by the attempt to overthrow the officials or to do something unlawful or harmful. Eg: "a conspiracy to destroy the government". There have been conspiracy statements made by religious leaders about foreign governments using vaccine programs for ethnic cleansing or other such conspiracy themes.

<h4>Vaccine Schedule:</h4> A schedule of vaccines that a newborn needs to take over the months and years since he/she is born. Some parents are known for skipping out the schedule to make it less packed or completely avoid scheduled immunizations. Anti-vaxxers often criticize the packed schedule of vaccine injection and blame the cause of diseases in children on the schedule. Some anti-vaxxers also criticize the skipping-out technique as having no use in preventing diseases that can be caused by vaccines and vaccination should be avoided completely. Booster shots are part of an immunization schedule where additional doses of vaccine is administered. Anti vaxxers tend to go against getting booster shots.  

<h4>Vaccination Rate:</h4> Percentage of children and adults who received certain vaccinations. Anti-vaxxers often connect the increasing rate of autism in children to the increasing rate of children receiving vaccines. They also tend to report incidents where disease outbreaks occur in populations that are largely vaccinated.

<h4>Research and Scientific Evidence:</h4> The systematic investigation into the study of materials and sources in order to establish facts and reach new conclusions; any provided research should be official and legal to be considered factual evidence. Definition of Scientific evidence: Evidence which serves to either support or counter a scientific theory or hypothesis. Such evidence is expected to be empirical evidence and interpretation in accordance with scientific method. Standards for scientific evidence vary according to the field of inquiry, but the strength of scientific evidence is generally based on the results of statistical analysis and the strength of scientific controls. (This includes evaluation and approval of facts and information about vaccination research and approval.)

<h4>Herd Immunity:</h4> The theory that if a population has a high rate of vaccinated people, it lowers the spread of diseases and protects the small portion of people who are not vaccinated. It is an important mechanism by which the larger community is protected. Anti-vaxxers often question the validity of this concept through incidents of disease outbreaks in a highly vaccinated population.

<h4>Vaccine Necessity:</h4> The necessary need for injecting vaccines. Anti-vaxxers often claim that it is not a necessity to vaccinate and people should have the freedom to choose whether they want to be vaccinated or not.

<h4>Others</h4> Other instances of targeted vaccination disinformation which does not fall in these categories

<h2>How to use the form:</h2>
You will be asked to indicate your choices regarding vaccine bias and misinformation content of an instagram post, comprising the image and caption. Text extracted from the images is also provided.
You can submit only a single answer to each question. A valid response is recorded only when both questions are answered. Submitting incomplete reponse redirects back to the post. 
You may also chose to "skip" a question if you are confident how to label it. You must "delete" a post if it is not related to vaccines/immunization.
